          p I was tasked with redesigning GuestDo's website for the launch of the app.
          p An existing website was already in place that the founders were happy with so I decided to use that as a starting point and inspiration. Many of the elements and all of the colors were kept since these are repeated inside the app.
          p The look I was going for was a modern but fun look, something that the pink and white color scheme really helped pull off.
          p The preview is a comparison between the original website and the new version. Since the old version was not built for mobile, the comparison is only between the desktop size of the site.
